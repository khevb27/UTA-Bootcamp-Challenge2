# UTA-Bootcamp-Challenge2
## Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

The purpose of this project is to showcase previous application samples while improving HTML and CSS skills. It also serves as a platform to display contact and resume information to potential employers. The site features a navigation bar that links to different sections of the page and external deployed projects. Goals of the project include having a larger first project image, clickable images that link to external deployed applications, and adapting to various viewport sizes. The site is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with the use of Flexbox and media queries for mobile-responsiveness.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
